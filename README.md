# Guess-My-Number

## Description

This is a simple game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 20. The game will tell the user if the number is too high or too low. If the user guesses the number, the game will tell the user how many attempts it took to guess the number. The game also record the highest score and display it on the screen.

Thanks to Jonas the person who created the course on Udemy that I followed to create this game.
